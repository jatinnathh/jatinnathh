# Hi, I'm Jatin Nath

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Full-Stack Developer** who loves turning ideas into real, working products.  
For me, it's not just about writing code—it's about designing intelligent systems, building clean architectures, and solving problems in a way that's scalable and impactful.

## About Me
- Currently studying at **Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam**
- Passionate about **AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**
- Experienced in **React Native**, **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, **Docker**, and **MySQL**
- I enjoy building complete solutions—from the first spark of an idea all the way to deployment
- Always learning, especially the theory behind algorithms and how to implement them from scratch
